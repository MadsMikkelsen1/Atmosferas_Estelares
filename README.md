### SPECTRAL ANALYSIS 

This script will perform normalisation of a series of test stars along with plotting the spectral lines of interest.
Firstly it is loading and plotting a chosen example star from the "ExampleStar" folder using a user input in the terminal.
Next it is plotting a test star with (currently only) the Balmer series from 3900 Å to 6500 Å overlay as red vertical lines.
